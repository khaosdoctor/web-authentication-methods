# Web Authentication Methods

> Series of small implemented programs to showcase the most common web authentication methods

This is part of a talk I gave at [NodeBR's 46th meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nodebr/events/258798150/) in SÃ£o Paulo.

## Summary

All examples can be run using `node index.js`, if it requires further configuration a README file will be present along with it.
